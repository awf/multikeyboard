multikeyboard
=============

A windows keyboard layout that easily allows entry of a wide range of roman-alphabet characters.
It uses AltGr (Or Ctrl+Alt) with accent keys to accent the next key pressed.   Examples:

  
| Keystrokes | Result   | Notes       |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---- |
| AltGr-` e | è | Backtick is the top left key on my keyboard |
| AltGr-' e | é | |
| AltGr-2 u | ü | Mnemonic is that the " looks a bit like an umlaut, but there's no need to shift the 2 key |
| AltGr-6 a | â | Shift 6 is caret, but again, why require the additional shift key... |
| AltGr-/ o | ø | |
| AltGr-o A | Å | |
| AltGr-~ n | ñ | This didn't work in my browser just now, but works in my shell.. |



And a very incomplete set of mathematical symbols:

| Keystrokes | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| AltGr-\ g | ∇ |
| AltGr-\ k | κ |
| AltGr-\ l | λ |
| X AltGr-\ 1 | X₁ |
| X AltGr-\ 2 | X₂ |
